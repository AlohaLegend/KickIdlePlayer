# and AFK players will be kicked (longest AFK first, one at a time).

# Enable or disable kicking when the server is "full"
enable-full-mode: true

# Message used when kicking due to full server
kick-afking-full-message: "&cYou were kicked because the server is full and you are AFK."

# AFK longer than [max-idle-time] will be kicked.
kick-tps: 10.0

# Enable or disable TPS-based AFK kicking
enable-tps-mode: true

# Message used when kicking due to low TPS
